This app relies on a few libraries to work

* [**GLFW**](https://www.glfw.org/) to manage the window creation and events.
* [**ImGui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to build the user interface.
* [**Native File Dialog**](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended) to pop up the open and pick folder dialog windows.
